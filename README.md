# EULAG-Framework
The work I do around the EULAG simulation. Included are scripts that facilitate handling the code and postprocessing, as well as a script that generates a landcover map for the lower boundary of the simulation. The EULAG code is unfortunatley not included, please contact Piotr Smolarkiewicz for that.
